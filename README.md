# Data Analysis Spotify
## *Status*
Project completed, in collaboration with: [Léo COLIN](https://github.com/leocoooo), [Nguyen Thao Nhi VO](https://github.com/vonguyenthaonhi), and Léa HOARAU.
## *Description*
This project aims to build an interactive graphical interface, allowing the user to perform various searches related to music through the use of an artist name, a song name, or according to a year and a specific genre.
In order to become familiar with the data, a descriptive analysis was carried out beforehand, accompanied by a visualization of the data.
The results obtained through the interface come from the datasets present in the "Data" folder, which were collected on Kaggle:
- Source 1: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-600k-tracks
- Source 2: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sadeghhoushyar/top-200-most-streamed-songs-on-spotify-2020?select=spotify_top200_global.csv

Here is the final rendering of our interface:
